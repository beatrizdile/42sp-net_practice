The net_practice project is an introduction to networking fundamentals, specifically focusing on IP addressing, subnet masking, and routing. It serves as a practical exercise to equip students with the foundational knowledge for understanding computer networks.

## Description

This project focuses on networks, it was designed to help students gain practical experience in networking concepts and protocols, it aims to provide hands-on experience with networking fundamentals, including but not limited to:

- Socket programming
- TCP/IP protocol stack
- Client-server architecture
- Network troubleshooting
- Packet analysis

Students will implement various networking tasks and challenges, progressively enhancing their understanding of how data is transmitted over networks and how different networking protocols operate.

## Features

- **Socket Programming Exercises:** Implement socket-based communication between client and server applications.
- **TCP/IP Protocol Analysis:** Explore the TCP/IP protocol stack and learn how to analyze network traffic.
- **Network Troubleshooting:** Debug and resolve common networking issues.
- **Protocol Implementation:** Implement custom network protocols for specific applications.
